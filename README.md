# Resume Parsing and Matching with Job Descriptions using spaCy

## Overview

This project focuses on extracting key information (name, education, work experience, skills) from resumes and matching them with job descriptions using spaCy, a powerful NLP library in Python.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **spaCy**: Used for NLP tasks including tokenization, named entity recognition, etc.
- **pickle**: Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects (for storing and loading trained models and data).
- **scikit-learn**: Useful for various machine learning tasks such as text vectorization and similarity scoring (if needed).
- **Other standard Python libraries**: Like `random` for shuffling data during training, and `spacy.training.example.Example` for creating training examples.

You can install these libraries using pip:
